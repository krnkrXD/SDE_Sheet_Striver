**How to Solve the SDE Sheet?**
For every problem you solve:
1. Make a notebook and write every question there.
2. Pin down the approach in _3-4 lines_, write the _pseudocode_, and the time complexity.
3. Every morning you get up in these 90 days, _revise_ the entire notebook.
4. Motivation: On the first day it might take you a lot of time to revise, but eventually, with every passing day, the time span will reduce, and there will be a day where you will revise the entire sheet in under 15 minutes.
